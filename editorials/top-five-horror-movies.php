      <h2>Top Five Upcoming Horror Movies</h2>
      <h5>Date created: <?php echo date ?> </h5>
        <p> With the pandemic looming, outside of the films that came out in the early month of the year,
        many of the horror movies we have been looking forward too have been postponed. In the near future,
        we will be looking forward to some of these movies. </p>

              <h4> Antlers (2021): </h4>A mysterious creature escapes from its confines to wreak bloody havoc in a small Oregon town.
              <br><br>
              This was one movie I was looking forward to the most. Starring Jesse Plemons and Keri Russell,
              this movie is rumored to be a Wendigo monster film, which has many of us salivating!
              Currently, it is indefinitely postponed so we hope for a quick release for this film.

                <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9639470/"> <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGEwNzBjMmUtMzRkMS00MTFkLWI5MmUtMDhkYTg3MGJkYTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQ2NTA5ODQ@._V1_UY1200_CR108,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg" class="poster"
                    alt="LastNightInSoho.png"></a>
               <h4>Last Night in Soho (2021): </h4>A young girl, passionate about fashion design, is mysteriously able to enter the 1960s where she encounters her idol, a dazzling wannabe singer. But 1960s London is not what it seems, and
              time seems to fall apart with shady consequences.
              <br><br>
              A horror movie directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead & Hot Fuzz)? Sign me up! This also features the ever underated
              Anya Taylor-Joy and should be a blast! Much like Antlers, this is also indefinitely postponed with a hopeful 2021 release.

              <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342730/"> <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWOyw1rUMAAnILh.jpg" class="poster" alt="spiral_movieposter.png"></a>
              <h4> Spiral: From the Book of Saw: </h4> A sadistic mastermind unleashes a twisted form of justice in Spiral, the terrifying new chapter from the book of Saw.
              <br><br>
              Who would have thought that the next sequel to Saw series would be helmed and star Chris Rock? Not only that, Samuel L. Jackson also has what is expected to me a meaty roll in the movie too. It almost sounds like an SNL skit, but it's
              happening!

              <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10665338/"> <img src="https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/halloween-kills-02-v2-2-1200x1901-1-1024x1622.jpg" class="poster" alt="halloween_kills.png"></a>
              <h4> Halloween Kills: </h4> The saga of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode continues in the next thrilling chapter of the Halloween series.
              <br><br>
              What was expected to be a solid Halloween release has been delayed to next Halloween. Thankfully clearing up one of the most convuluted storylines in horror history, the reboot of Halloween ignores all the sequels trappings and sticks
              with just the original.
              This sequel will continue that legacy in what is expected to be a trilogy. It sounds like Michael Myers won't be stopped in this movie, but with original scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis and the oh so underrated Judy Greer still attached,
              I have high hopes when this releases
              next Halloween.</p>
