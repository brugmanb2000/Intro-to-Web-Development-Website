### Summary
This is a website I created for my CS 401 Intro to Web Development class. My website is a horror-themed movie review website where users are able to comment on articles written by the author team on the website. This website is a mix of HTML5/CSS/PHP/JavaScript with MySQL as the database used to store username/passwords. 

Some parts of the website aren't as "pretty" as I would like, but the focus on this class was more on the backend. This website was built incrementally as we learned about HTML/CSS/etc, so now with all that knowledge under my belt my next project would be built better.
